This dashboard was developed as part of a frontend coding challenge aimed at assessing data visualization, responsiveness, and interactivity skills in a modern web application.

I was provided with a starter frontend setup (routes and a menu bar) and asked to implement a dashboard to visualize business performance metrics. The goal was not only to deliver functional visualizations, but also to create an intuitive and responsive UI that reflects good design and development principles.

This challenge was a great opportunity to showcase both my frontend engineering skills and my creative problem-solving approach. It was completed using TypeScript, React, and Chart.js, and deployed using Bun for its speed and minimal tooling overhead.

Included a solution.md file explaining the approach, tools used, and reasoning behind design decisions.
