# Keaz frontend code challenge

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in joining our team as a Junior Frontend Developer!

We’re kicking off the process with a coding challenge. This helps us to quickly understand if our approaches to problem-solving, development and creativity are aligned. We know your time is valuable, and we respect that. This challenge is designed to take anywhere from two to four hours, depending on how much time you’d like to invest. Please approach it in a way that feels right to you. The requirements are meant as guidelines but feel free to make the challenge "yours", so if you want to hyper-focus on interactivity, are interested in building smooth animations, or care for the prettiest graphs you are invited to do so. The output should rather be a reflection of your abilities and interests than a "rational solution".

We’re excited to see how you think through problems and look forward to your solutions!

## The Challenge

In this challenge, we provide a small working extract from our frontend containing just the base routes and a menubar. You are tasked with implementing the dashboard, featuring interactive visualizations  of metrics for customers to understand their Keaz performance. In order to reduce complexity, the data is directly returned from the `clientLoader` as JSON but in the same structure as if it were to come from the backend.

The following tasks will ask you to build the dashboard with increasing complexity. Please read everything carefully before starting to avoid unnecessary refactoring. We are consciously not providing a Figma design to see what you come up with. Remember that the challenge is primarily about your ability to build. You are free to choose how you implement the tasks, you can build things more by yourself or use existing libraries. Just be sure to document your choices later. AI assisted systems, like Cursor, are totally fine, just be sure to own the main part of your work and be able to explain it. Have fun!

### 1 - Visualize the metrics

Start by using the data from the `useLoaderData` and visualize the four values in different ways. You can decide how to display them, but we would like to see at least one pie and one bar chart.

### 2 - Make it responsive

We now want to make sure the site also work on mobile devices. Please adapt both the layout and metrics to work on smaller screens. Don't worry about too many break points, it's fine to have one for big and one for small screens.

### 3 - Show trends

Certain data has historical values included to show trends, eg. improvements over time. Adapt the visualizations to be able to show the difference on interaction, like mouse click. If possible, this is a great way to show your animation skills, just be sure to not over do it.

### 4 - Document

Write ~200 words about your approach to solve the challenge. You can focus your writing on how or why you implemented things, what was difficult or why you choose a certain design. Please save this in a formatted Markdown file called `solution.md`. We kindly ask you to write this yourself without using AI. Also include screenshots or a screencast of the dashboard running. Extra points if we can check the dashboard out live!
